I had the please of working with Chris for around 2 years at Engagement Factory, while collaborating on several project teams. Chris's ability to juggle multiple projects while always committing to the highest quality is truly exceptional. Hence the reason I would say Chris is one of the most dedicated professionals I've worked with and he's always willing to go the extra mile to help you when needed. Thanks Chris! "
